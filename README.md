# Sleekmeeter

A modern face for Voicemeeter Banana. Sleekmeeter sits on top of Voicemeeter and controls it through the official Voicemeeter Remote API — Voicemeeter keeps doing the audio, Sleekmeeter is just a nicer mixer to look at and use.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 (WebView2 comes with both)
- Voicemeeter Banana installed (Sleekmeeter loads `VoicemeeterRemote64.dll` from its install folder)

## Run it

Sleekmeeter is portable: put `Sleekmeeter.exe` in any folder and run it. Scenes are saved in a `scenes` folder next to the exe.

If Voicemeeter isn't running, Sleekmeeter offers to start it. Closing the window keeps Sleekmeeter in the tray; left-click the tray icon to bring it back, right-click → **Quit Sleekmeeter** to exit.

## Using the mixer

| Do this | To |
| --- | --- |
| Drag a fader (hold **Shift** for fine moves) | Change level |
| Double-click a fader | Reset to 0 dB |
| Scroll over a fader (**Alt** for 0.1 dB steps) | Nudge by 1 dB |
| Focus a fader, then ↑ ↓ / PgUp PgDn / 0 | Keyboard control |
| Click **A1–A3 / B1–B2** on an input | Route it to that output |
| Double-click a name (or F2) | Rename the strip or bus in Voicemeeter |
| **Scenes** | Save or recall your whole Voicemeeter setup |
| **⋯** menu | Show the Voicemeeter window, restart the audio engine, clear solos |

Meters show post-fader levels on the same scale as the fader, so you can see signal and fader position together. Everything stays in sync with Voicemeeter itself, MIDI controllers and other remote apps.

## Build it

### Option A: GitHub Actions (no tools needed)

Push this folder to a GitHub repository. The included workflow (`.github/workflows/build-windows.yml`) builds on a Windows runner; download **Sleekmeeter-portable** from the run's Artifacts section.

### Option B: on your PC

1. Install [Rust](https://rustup.rs) (default MSVC toolchain, with the Visual Studio C++ build tools it asks for) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) 20+.
2. In this folder:
   ```
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```
3. The app is at `src-tauri\target\release\sleekmeeter.exe`.

For live development with Voicemeeter running: `npm run dev`.

## Preview the UI without Windows

Open `src/index.html` in any browser. With no Voicemeeter available it runs against a simulated Voicemeeter Banana. Add `?offline` to the URL to see the "not running" screen.

## How it works

- `src-tauri/src/vm.rs` finds Voicemeeter through its uninstall registry key, loads `VoicemeeterRemote64.dll`, and wraps the `VBVMR_*` functions (login, get/set parameters, levels, run).
- `src-tauri/src/main.rs` polls `VBVMR_IsParametersDirty` and `VBVMR_GetLevel` about 30 times a second, sends `vm-state` and `vm-levels` events to the window, and exposes commands for setting parameters and managing scenes.
- `src/` is the interface (plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript). `engine.js` talks to the Rust side inside the app, or to the simulator in a browser.

Parameter names follow the Voicemeeter Remote API documentation (e.g. `Strip[0].Gain`, `Strip[3].B1`, `Bus[0].Mute`), so adding more controls is mostly a matter of adding buttons that call `engine.setFloat(...)`.
